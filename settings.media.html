<p><strong>You will need php-gd installed on your server to use this feature.</strong></p>

<h2>Media Settings</h2>

<h3>Image sizes</h3>

<p>The sizes listed below determine the maximum dimensions in pixels to use when inserting an image into the body of a post.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Thumbnail size - Enter the Width and Height
        <ul>
            <li>Crop thumbnail to exact dimensions (normally thumbnails are proportional) - check box</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Medium size - Enter the Max Width and Max Height</li>
    <li>Large size - Enter the Max Width and Max Height</li>
</ul>

<h3>Uploading Files</h3>

<p>Default settings used for during the media upload process when writing a post.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Organize my uploads into month- and year-based folders - Check this box if you wish to organize your uploads into folders based on the year and the month of the upload. As of 3.5, wp-content/uploads is the default path setting for the uploads folder. Assuming this is your path setting, if you check this box, a file uploaded in June of 2010 would be placed into the wp-content/uploads/2010/06 folder. Note: At the time of the actual upload, WordPress will automatically create the folders, such as wp-content/uploads/2010 and wp-content/uploads/2010/06, as long as your wp-content folder is writeable.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Save Changes</h4>

<p>Click the Save Changes button to ensure any changes you have made to your Settings are saved to your database. Once you click the button, a confirmation text box will appear at the top of the page telling you your settings have been saved.</p>
