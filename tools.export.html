<h1>Tools Export Screen</h1>

<p>Exporting your WordPress data (posts, pages, custom post types, comments, custom fields, categories, tags, custom taxonomies, and users) is sometimes necessary and useful. If you are moving to a new host or just want a backup of your site data, then Exporting your site is the answer. Once the Export file is created, that file can be used for import by the Tools Import Screen.</p>

<p>The Tools Export Screen is quite simple--just specify the desired Filters, if any, you wish to apply, and then click the Download Export File button to save that file to your local computer.</p>

<p>Back to Administration Screens.</p>

<h2>Export</h2>

<p>When you click the Download Export File button, WordPress will create an XML file for you to save to your computer.</p>

<p>This format, which is called and WordPress eXtended RSS or WXR file, will contain your posts, pages, custom post types, comments, custom fields, categories, tags, custom taxonomies, and users.</p>

<p>Once youâ€™ve saved the download file, you can use Administration > Tools > Import > WordPress at another WordPress site to import this data. Note, if using the importer plugin, it has to be enabled.</p>
