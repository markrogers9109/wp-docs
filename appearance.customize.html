<h1>Appearance Customize Screen</h1>

<p>WordPress Version 3.4 introduced Theme Customizer and Version 3.6 directly linked it from Appearance > Customize. Also, the Theme Options Screen has been renamed Customize Screen. It allows a Theme author to give users the chance to change certain Theme features such as color and layout in a live preview format.</p>

<p>Please note, the Customize Screen is only available if the active theme supports a Customize ability. In addition, this screen will likely be different for each Theme that enables and builds it. The Customize Screen for WordPress Twenty Sixteen theme, for example, provides options to change the Colors and select a background image.</p>

<h2>Theme Customizer</h2>

<p>The Theme Customizer allows you to preview changes to your site before publishing them. You can also navigate to different pages on your site to preview them. Version 4.5 added Device Preview Buttons at the bottom of the Customizer pane. It shows how your site looks in mobile, tablet, and desktop contexts before making changes to its appearance.</p>

<p>Tips: From Version 4.5, shift-click on nav menu items in preview screen to open corresponding control in Customizer pane. Active Theme field shows current customizing theme name is displayed. You cannot activate other themes or install new one from this Customizer. Go to Administration > Appearance > Themes.</p>
